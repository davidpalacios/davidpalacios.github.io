During the following months I’ll be working on the [XML Reports][xml-reports-wiki-page] project under the supervision of [Michael Seaton][mseaton] as part of the [GSoC 2015][gsoc2015] program.

An abstract of the project is as follows:

<blockquote>
The reporting module provides to the users of the OpenMRS software with a user-friendly interface and an API for developers to manage reports, and since its first release the module has been adding new features to continuously adapt to its users’ needs. Currently, there isn’t an easy way to share reports between implementations of the OpenMRS platform and adding this feature is what this project aims to.
The goal of the XML Reports project is to design and add to the module a new markup-like descriptor that uses the features of the XML language to describe reports in a textual data format, along with a new set of user-friendly interfaces that supports the new descriptor and its elements.
</blockquote>

The title of the next posts releated to this project will begin with "XML Reports".
